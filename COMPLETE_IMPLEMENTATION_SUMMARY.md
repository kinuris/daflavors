## 🚀 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Database Relationships
```python
# Many-to-Many relationship allows flexible event type assignments
class Caterer(models.Model):
    provider = models.ForeignKey(ProviderProfile, related_name='caterers')  # Changed from OneToOne
    event_types = models.ManyToManyField(EventType, related_name='caterers')

class EventType(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    icon = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)  # Emojis or CSS classes
    display_order = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
```

### Key Design Decisions
