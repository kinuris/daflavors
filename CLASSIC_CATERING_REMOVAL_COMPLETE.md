# CLASSIC CATERING PROVIDER REMOVAL - COMPLETION REPORT

## TASK COMPLETED
Successfully removed the `classic.catering` provider and all references to it from the sample data creation script.

## CHANGES MADE

### 1. Removed Classic Catering Provider Data
**File:** `accounts/management/commands/create_sample_data.py`

**Removed the following provider entry from the `provider_data` array:**
```python
{
    'user': {
        'username': 'classic.catering',
        'email': 'info@classicatering.com',
        'password': 'provider123',
        'first_name': 'Classic',
        'last_name': 'Catering',
        'phone_number': '+63 2 7777 8888',
        'address': 'Pasig City'
    },
    'profile': {
        'business_name': 'Classic Catering Services',
        'business_description': 'Premium catering services for all occasions',
        'business_email': 'events@classicatering.com',
        'business_phone': '+63 2 7777 8888',
        'business_address': 'Pasig City',
        'service_area': 'Metro Manila, Cavite',
        'verified': True
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Caterer Creation Logic
**Before:** Caterer was assigned to `providers[1]` (Classic Catering)
**After:** Caterer is now assigned to `providers[0]` (Grand Palace) with a service name

**Updated caterer creation:**
```python
# Create a caterer for the same provider (Grand Palace also offers catering)
caterer = Caterer.objects.create(
    provider=providers[0],  # Now uses Grand Palace instead of Classic Catering
    service_name='Grand Palace Catering',  # Added service name for clarity
    specialty='International Cuisine',
    # ... rest of the fields remain the same
)
```

### 3. Updated Success Message
**Changed from:** `f'Created caterer: {caterer.provider.business_name}'`
**Changed to:** `f'Created caterer: {caterer.service_name}'`
