## Managing Venues

### Venue List View
**Location:** Admin Panel ‚Üí Venues ‚Üí Venues

**Key Features:**
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status for each venue
  - üü¢ **‚úÖ ACTIVE** - Service is active and available for bookings
  - üü† **‚è∏Ô∏è INACTIVE** - Service is temporarily inactive (owner-controlled)
  - üî¥ **üö´ SUSPENDED** - Service has been suspended by admin

- **Search Functionality**: Search by venue name, business name, or address

### Suspending a Venue

2. Scroll to the **"Admin Controls"** section
3. **To Suspend:**
   - Check ‚òëÔ∏è **"Is suspended"**
   - Enter suspension reason in **"Suspension reason"** field
   - Click **"Save"**
   - The system automatically records:
     - Suspension timestamp
     - Admin user who performed the action

---

## Managing Caterers

### Caterer List View
**Location:** Admin Panel ‚Üí Caterers ‚Üí Caterers

**Features Mirror Venue Management:**
- Same color-coded status indicators (‚úÖ ACTIVE, ‚è∏Ô∏è INACTIVE, üö´ SUSPENDED)

1. Click on caterer business name
2. Navigate to **"Admin Controls"** section
3. Toggle **"Is suspended"** checkbox
4. Provide suspension reason
5. Save changes

### Caterer-Specific Considerations
- **Menu Impact**: Suspended caterers' menus are filtered from booking forms
- **Package Filtering**: Menu packages become unavailable for new bookings
- **Service Visibility**: Catering services hidden from public caterer listings

---

---

## Frontend Impact & User Experience

## Best Practices

### Suspension Guidelines

#### When to Suspend
- **Quality Issues**: Service quality complaints or violations
- **Policy Violations**: Breach of platform terms of service
- **Safety Concerns**: Health, safety, or legal compliance issues
- **Fraud Prevention**: Suspected fraudulent activity
- **Investigation Period**: While investigating reported issues

#### Suspension Reasons
Always provide clear, professional suspension reasons:

**Good Examples:**
- "Suspended pending investigation of service quality complaints"
- "Temporary suspension for policy review and compliance verification"
- "Suspended due to health department violations - requires updated certification"

**Avoid:**
- Vague reasons ("Issues with service")
- Personal comments
- Legal accusations without proper investigation

### Communication Protocol

#### Before Suspension
1. **Document Issues**: Keep records of complaints or violations
2. **Attempt Resolution**: Contact provider to address issues first
3. **Set Clear Expectations**: Communicate requirements for reactivation

#### During Suspension
1. **Provide Clear Reason**: Use the suspension reason field effectively
2. **Maintain Communication**: Work with provider on resolution
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track remediation efforts

#### Reactivation Process
1. **Verify Resolution**: Ensure issues have been addressed
2. **Update Records**: Document the resolution
3. **Unsuspend Service**: Remove suspension with clear notification

---

## Administrative Reports

### Available Reports
The system provides several ways to monitor service health:

#### 1. Status Distribution Report
- Count of active vs suspended services
- Trends over time
- Service type breakdown

#### 2. Suspension Activity Log
- Recent suspension/unsuspension actions
- Admin action tracking
- Reason categorization

#### 3. Provider Impact Analysis
- Providers with multiple suspensions
- Resolution timeframes
- Service recovery patterns

### Generating Reports
Reports can be generated through:
- **Django Admin**: Built-in filtering and export capabilities
- **Admin Actions**: Custom bulk actions for common tasks
- **Data Export**: CSV/Excel export for external analysis

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Still Appears After Suspension
**Cause**: Browser caching or CDN delays
**Solution**: 
- Check suspension status in admin
- Clear browser cache
- Verify database changes took effect

#### Provider Cannot See Suspension Status
**Cause**: Template caching or user not logged in
**Solution**:
- Ensure provider is logged in as service owner
- Check template updates are deployed
- Verify user permissions

#### Booking Forms Not Updated
**Cause**: Form queryset caching
**Solution**:
- Restart Django application
- Check form initialization code
- Verify database query filters

### Support Contacts
For technical issues with the admin system:
- **Development Team**: [development@daflavors.com]
- **System Administrator**: [admin@daflavors.com]
- **Emergency Contact**: [urgent@daflavors.com]

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Admin-Only Access**: Suspension controls restricted to staff users
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged with timestamps
- **Role Separation**: Different permission levels for different admin roles

### Data Protection
- **Business Data Safety**: Core business information protected from modification
- **Backup Procedures**: Regular backups before major administrative actions
- **Change Logging**: Complete audit trail of all status changes

### Privacy Compliance
- **Data Retention**: Suspension records retained per legal requirements
- **Information Disclosure**: Suspension reasons visible only to relevant parties
- **GDPR Compliance**: Admin actions comply with data protection regulations

---

## System Architecture

### Database Design
The suspension system adds these fields to venue and caterer models:
- `is_active`: Boolean flag for general availability
- `is_suspended`: Boolean flag for administrative suspension
- `suspension_reason`: Text field for admin-provided reason
- `suspended_at`: Timestamp of suspension action
- `suspended_by`: Foreign key to admin user who performed action

### Integration Points
- **Booking Forms**: Automatic queryset filtering
- **Public Views**: Service filtering in list and detail views
- **Search Results**: Exclusion from public search
- **Admin Interface**: Visual indicators and management tools

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for status filtering
- **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate cache invalidation on status changes
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient filtering in high-traffic views
