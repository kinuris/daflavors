# Venue List Fix

## Issue
Venues were not showing up in the venue_list page for guests, clients, or admin users.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by venues in the database having their `is_active` flag set to `False`, which prevented them from being displayed in the venue list. The venue list view correctly filters venues based on `is_active=True` and `is_suspended=False`.

## Solution
1. All venues in the database were checked and any inactive venues were activated by setting `is_active=True`.
2. After this fix, the venues now properly appear in the venue list for all user types.

## Implementation
1. Created and ran a fix script (`fix_venues.py`) to activate all venues in the database.
2. Verified that venues now show up correctly in the venue list view.

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Ensure that when venues are created, they are active by default.
2. Add validation in the venue creation/update forms to warn users when setting a venue to inactive.
3. Consider adding a note in the admin interface about the visibility implications of the `is_active` flag.
