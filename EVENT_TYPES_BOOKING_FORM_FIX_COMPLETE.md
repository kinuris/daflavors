# EVENT TYPES VISIBILITY FIX - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: Event types were not visible when users were selecting caterers during the booking process, making it difficult for customers to choose the right caterer for their specific event type.

**Solution**: Updated the booking form to display caterers with their associated event types in the dropdown selection.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/bookings/views.py`
**Changes Made:**
- **booking_create function**: Added `caterers_with_event_types` context variable
- **booking_update function**: Added `caterers_with_event_types` context variable

```python
# Added to both functions:
caterers_with_event_types = Caterer.objects.filter(
    is_active=True, 
    is_suspended=False
).prefetch_related('event_types').select_related('provider')

context = {
    # ...existing context...
    'caterers_with_event_types': caterers_with_event_types,
}
```

#### 2. `/templates/bookings/booking_form.html`
**Changes Made:**
- Updated caterer selection dropdown to use `caterers_with_event_types` context
- Added logic to display event types with icons alongside caterer business names
- Maintained fallback to original form queryset if context is not available

```html
<!-- Enhanced caterer selection with event types -->
<select name="{{ form.caterer.name }}" id="{{ form.caterer.id_for_label }}" class="...">
    <option value="">Select a caterer</option>
    {% if caterers_with_event_types %}
        {% for caterer in caterers_with_event_types %}
            <option value="{{ caterer.id }}">
                {{ caterer.provider.business_name }}
                {% if caterer.event_types.all %} - 
                    {% for event_type in caterer.event_types.all|slice:":3" %}
                        {% if event_type.icon %}{{ event_type.icon }} {% endif %}{{ event_type.name }}
                        {% if not forloop.last %}, {% endif %}
                    {% endfor %}
                    {% if caterer.event_types.count > 3 %} (+{{ caterer.event_types.count|add:"-3" }} more){% endif %}
                {% endif %}
            </option>
        {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
        <!-- Fallback to original form queryset -->
        {% for choice in form.caterer.field.queryset %}
            <option value="{{ choice.id }}">{{ choice.provider.business_name }}</option>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
</select>
```
